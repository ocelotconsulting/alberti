# alberti
A secret management system written in Node.js and utilizing AWS KMS. This project will help applications securely store and access their secrets (DB passwords,
authentication keys, credentials, etc.).

## Current Status
Under development (10-19-2016).

## Rings
This code is used as the basis to create/get/delete secrets. The access mechanisms will be known as 'rings'. Ring is both a play on the 'decoder ring' which cipher disks devolved into, as well as a synonym for disk like the inner/outer disk/ring of the original cipher disk.

Here is a [list of planned/existing rings](https://github.com/ocelotconsulting/alberti/blob/master/Rings.md).

## Leon Battista Alberti
An Italian architect and author named [Leon Battista Alberti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher_disk) invented the cipher disk in 1470. It was used to encipher/decipher secrets.
